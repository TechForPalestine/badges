# Badges for peace in Palestine

These badges are intended to show support for an end to violence in Gaza, and a
long-term peace between the people of Israel and Palestine. To accomplish
this, we must support the people of Palestine in their desire for human rights
and equality, which these badges indicate support for.

See discussion below for how and why we built these.

# Default badge

[![Ceasefire Now](https://badge.techforpalestine.org/default)](https://techforpalestine.org/learn-more)

```
[![Ceasefire Now](https://badge.techforpalestine.org/default)](https://techforpalestine.org/learn-more)

```

The default badge is served from Tech For Palestine servers, allowing us to
update the message as appropriate. The initial badge says "Ceasefire now", but
will change if a ceasefire is achieved, to indicate the next goal for
Palestinian freedom. The message will always be carefully calibrated so that you
don't need to be an expert in politics or foreign policy to support, and will
always be positive and support the humanity of the Palestinian and Israeli
people.

# Static badges

The following badges will not change message, allowing you control the message you
support.

# Alternatives

We recommend using a message you're comfortable with - it's more important to
have your support than to use one of our messages.

To use your own custom badge, you can use the following code, inserting your own
message and alt text.

```
![ADD ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.shields.io/badge/YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE-%F0%9F%87%B5%F0%9F%87%B8%20Tech_For_Palestine-D83838?labelColor=01B861&color=D83838&link=https%3A%2F%2Ftechforpalestine.org%2Flearn-more)
```

![ADD ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%87%B5%F0%9F%87%B8_YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE-techforpalestine.org-000?labelColor=grey&color=D83838&link=https%3A%2F%2Ftechforpalestine.org%2Flearn-more)

# How to spread

It is valuable to have these badges on as many repos as possible. However, in
some cases these badges will be contentious. We would suggest adding them to
your own repos, and then mentioning publicly or in your communities that you has
done so. Merely seeing them will allow people already sympathetic to join the
cause, and allow those who do not know what to think know that there is support
for Palestine within tech.

Once a base of support has built, it will hopefully become easier for larger
projects, especially projects which previously supported Ukraine or BLM, to
speak up about ending the genocide in Gaza. These conversations should be
started by core contributors, not by outsiders.

# Goals and design

They are part of Tech For Palestine's mission to help humanize the people of
Palestine.

Adding a badge is way to show support within the tech community for peace in Gaza, and for an end to violence against civilians.

The badges offer a variety of messages with a common branding and a common link
target. By design, most badges are low-risk and are designed for those just
learning about the conflict and hoping for peace, while some are designed for
those with a better understanding, and take a more principled approach. You
should use the badge that feels appropriate to you.
