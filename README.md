# Badges supporting peace in Palestine

These badges, in the immediate term, are intended to show support for an end to the current phase of violence in Palestine, primarily in Gaza. In the longer term, they are meant to show support for a free Palestine and a lasting justice and peace.

To accomplish this, we must support the people of Palestine in their desire for human rights and equality, which these badges are intended to indicate support for.

## List of organizations calling for a ceasefire

You will be joining dozens of international organizations who are calling for a ceasefire. These are a few of the organizations calling for a ceasefire:

- [Oxfam](https://www.oxfam.org/en/open-call-immediate-ceasefire-occupied-palestinian-territory)
- [A coalition of humanitarian organizations](https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/inter-agency-standing-committee/we-need-immediate-humanitarian-ceasefire-statement-principals-inter-agency-standing-committee), including the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, [Save the Children](https://www.savethechildren.net/), [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/), [UNCHR](https://www.unhcr.org/), among others
- [Amnesty International](https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/nearly-1-million-across-u-s-call-for-ceasefire-now/)

# Default badge

```md
[![Ceasefire Now](https://badge.techforpalestine.org/default)](https://techforpalestine.org/learn-more)
```

The default badge is served from Tech For Palestine servers, allowing us to
update the message as appropriate. The initial badge says "Ceasefire now", but
will change if a ceasefire is achieved, to indicate the next goal for
Palestinian freedom. The message will always be carefully calibrated so that you
don't need to be an expert in politics or foreign policy to support, and will
always be positive and support the humanity of the Palestinian and Israeli
people.

# Static badges

The following badges will not change message, allowing you to control the message you

# Variations

We recommend using a message you're comfortable with - it's more important to
have your support than to use one of our messages.

To use your own custom badge, you can use the following code, inserting your own
message and alt text. The `color` and `labelColor` parameters are also
customizable.

```
![ADD ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%87%B5%F0%9F%87%B8_YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE-techforpalestine.org-000?labelColor=grey&color=D83838&link=https%3A%2F%2Ftechforpalestine.org%2Flearn-more)

# How to help

It is valuable to have these badges on as many repos as possible. However, in
some cases these badges will be contentious. We would suggest adding them to
your own repos, and then mentioning publicly or in your communities that you have
done so. Merely seeing them will allow people already sympathetic to join the
cause, and allow those who do not know what to think know that there is support
for Palestine within tech.

Once a base of support has built, it will hopefully become easier for larger
projects, especially projects which previously supported Ukraine or BLM, to
speak up about ending the genocide in Gaza. These conversations should be
started by core contributors, not by outsiders.

# Goals and design

They are part of Tech For Palestine's mission to help humanize the people of
Palestine.

Adding a badge is way to show support within the tech community for peace in Gaza, and for an end to violence against civilians.

The badges offer a variety of messages with a common branding and a common link
target. By design, most badges are low-risk and are designed for those just
learning about the conflict and hoping for peace, while some are designed for
those with a better understanding, and take a more principled approach. You
should use the badge that feels appropriate to you.

# Implementation

Badges are implemented as Cloudflare redirects to
[shields.io](https://shields.io). Those with access to the techforpalestine
cloudflare account can make changes in the "badges" Bulk Redirect List.
